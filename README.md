# Harmonic-Mean-Approach--HMA-
 A method for solving Transportation Problem

Harmonic Mean Approach Algorithm
1. Check wheter the given transportation problem is balanced or not. If not, balance or by adding dummy row or column. Then go to next step.
2. Find the harmonic mean for each row and each column. Then find the maximum value among that.
3. Allocate the minimum supply or demand at the place of minimum value of the related row or column.
4. Repeat the step 2 and 3 until all the demand are satisfied and all the the supplies are exhausted.
5. Total minimum cost = sum of the product of the cost and it's corresponding allocated values of supply or demand.
